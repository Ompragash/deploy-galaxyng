# Ansible Galaxy NG: Up and Running

[Galaxy NG](https://github.com/ansible/galaxy_ng) is the next generation Galaxy server to host Ansible contents based on [Pulp](https://github.com/pulp/pulp_ansible) plugin.

Galaxy NG is a rewrite of original Galaxy code developed by the same team that manages [galaxy.ansible.com](https://galaxy.ansible.com). It comes with a UI and supports only Collection for now.
